[Verse 1]
Starlit night
The moon is shining bright
You are the one that I need
Up at your window
I see a shadow
Silhouette of your grace
Here's this flower
I picked for all the hours
That you've spent with me
The one I love
That I've been dreaming of
Sailing across the sea

[Chorus]
Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer, a kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

[Verse 2]
Nothing's more
Than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh, so softly
Hands flowing down my back
1,000 hours, I'll never leave
Our romance
Is a love trance
And now we'll never part
1,000 hours
Of such a love shower
We'll never stop, once we start
[Chorus]
Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer, a kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

[Chorus]
Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer, a kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

Ahhh...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopyEvery night I dream the same dream
(Of getting older and older all the time)
I ask you now, what does this mean?
(Are these problems just in my mind?)
Things are easy when you're a child
(But now these pressures have dropped on my head)
The length I've gone are just long miles
(Would they be shorter if I were dead?)

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?

Look at my friends and see what they've done
(Ask myself why they've had to change)
I like 'em better when they were young
(Now all these times are rearranged)
I look down and stand there and cry
(Nothing ever will be the same)
The sun is rising, now I ask why?
(The clouds now fall and here comes the rain)

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair...? Go!
Every night I dream the same dream
(Of getting older and older all the time)
I ask you now, what does this mean?
(Are these problems just in my mind?)
Things are easy when you're a child

The length I've gone are just long miles

I sit alone in my bedroom
Starin' at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speedin', my love is yearnin'

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
She holds my malachite so tight, so
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
Years away!

I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can
I can't see her, but in the distance
I hear some laughter, we laugh together

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

[Chorus]
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

[Verse 2]
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins
[Chorus]
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died

A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born, and the first one to run

We are the class of, the class of '13
Born in the era of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969

[Verse 3]
My name is no one, the long lost son
Born on the 4th of July
Raised through the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive
I am a nation, a worker of pride (Hey!)
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands and a means to an end
It's all that I have to show
[Chorus]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 4]
I swallowed my pride and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control
I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet (Hey!)
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for judgement day

I praise liberty
The freedom to obey
It's the song that strangles me
Well, don't cross the line...

My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love?
Not as long as there are girls like you

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control, I wanna hurt myself

If anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
But you turn your head, and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I lose my head, or I bang it up against a wall

Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
And lock myself up in a padded room
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air
'Cause no one wants to hear a drunken fool

It makes me lose control, I just can't trust myself

Wonder if he knows I think he's crazy
When he was young did he have dreams of
Wearing women's shoes and being crazy?

These scars in my flesh
I'm bruised and I'm bloodied

He was due home yesterday, but he ain't here
Her man's been gone for nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday, but he ain't here

Down your street, your crying is a well-known sound
Your street is very well known throughout your town
Your town is very famous for a little girl
Whose crying can be heard all around the world

[Verse 3]
My name is Ivor, I'm an engine driver
I know him well, I know why you feel blue
Just 'cause he's late don't mean he'll never get through

He told me he loved you, he ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver

Starry nights, city lights coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown

Lost and found, city-bound in my dreams

["St. Jimmy"]

[Intro]
St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette
He's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of 1,2- 1,2,3,4!

[Verse 1]
My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves, and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment

[Chorus]
I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

[Verse 2]
Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city under a halo of lights
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized

[Chorus]
I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
[Ad Libs]
Are you talking to me?
I'll give you something to cry about
St. Jimmy

[Middle Eight]
My name is St. Jimmy I'm a son of a gun
I'm the one that's from the way outside, now
I'm a teenage assassin executing some fun
In the cult of the life of crime, now
I'd really hate to say it but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down, old boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
I'm the resident leader of the lost and found
It's comedy and tragedy
It's St. Jimmy
And that's my name
And don't wear it out!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy[Intro]

Stranded, lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy
I'm branded, maladjusted
Never trusted anyone, let alone myself

[Chorus]
I must insist on being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

[Verse 2]
Elected, the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot
No meaning and no healing
Self-loathing freak, an introverted deviant

I must insist on being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

Ashley! Are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?
Ashley! Are you bumming around?
You're crying on my cold shoulder

[Verse 1]
You used to dangle my heart with your puppet strings
You dangled your desires right in front of my face
You led me to the well, but wouldn't let me drink
Swallowing my pride, and I never even got the taste

[Pre-Chorus]
But time comes around and I'm not so naive
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I finally lost touch, 'cause you're so out of reach

You say that you're fine, but I know that you ain't

You are where you are
A wish on a shooting star
You are a filthy thought in my memory

I taste the cigarettes and liquor on your breath
We used to call it speed, but now it's crystal meth
Back when I loved you, but you're scaring me to death

Hey there lookin' at me
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit gray

[Chorus]
Staring across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

[Verse 2]
What is it that drives me mad?
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore?
What makes me feel so much pain?
That makes me go so insane
What is it about you that I adore?

Staring across the room
Are you leaving soon?

Why did you have to leave so soon?
Why did you have to walk away?

I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies, and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short, and my blood pressure is high
I lose control, and I get myself all wound up

Stuck in a rut, and I get myself all wound up
Killed my composure, it'll never come back

Blown out of proportion again
My temper snaps, and I get myself all wound up
Spontaneous combustion, panic attack

Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
Let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade

For a small town serenade
With fireworks on display
Tonight, it's a hero's welcome home
And there's no place else to go
And I'm taking it to the grave

The saddest story ever told (Bitter year)
Is feeling safe in our suburban homes
The soldiers of an endless war (Bitter year)

Described as severely mentally disturbed

Deserve to be annihilated

Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

Am I just paranoid?

I'm walking down the line
That divides mе somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone

Concrete dream (Hey!) I'm gonna make a scene
Radio covered in gasoline
Sleeping in reverse, and everybody's bouncing off the walls
Bombs away (Hey!) It's just another day
Of idle threats, the secret alphabet
I wouldn't sweat it, everybody's bouncing off the walls
I'm bouncing off the walls! Alright!

Concrete kiss (Hey!) Come on and do the twist
The radio, my little exorcist
We're all getting pissed, and everybody's bouncing off the walls

I'm counting sheep, but running out
As time ticks by, still I try
No rest for cross-tops in my mind

Dried up and bulging out my skull

Fucked up and spun out in my room

Mom and dad don't look so hot these days
They're getting over the hill
Death is closing in and catching up
As far as I can tell
Got a plan of action and cold blood
And it smells of defiance
I'll just wait for Mom and Dad to die
And get my inheritance

Well, now I want more, 'cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt, but it's all figured out
Well, nothing good can last

Crow's feet and rot are setting in
And time is running out
My parents' income interest rate

I'm a snot-nosed slob without a job
And I know I damn well should
Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days
But my future's looking good

Turn up the silence, the heartache of your life
Dance forever under the lights, this brutal love
Oh, how you want it, you're begging for it

In my smoked out boring room
My hair is shagging in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
Drive along these shit town lights

I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

So close to drowning, but I don't mind

Throw my emotions in the grave

Breaking in a sweat like a bomb threat
Is your silhouette fading out?

Bottle rockets that celebrate, celebrate, celebrate

Dominated by passersbys

Another promise to make a change
Got a broken wing, hear the angels sing
When the signal is out of range

Of no return and no looking back or down

Staring out of my window
Watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone
I've got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently
Watching the clock tick so slowly
Gotta get away
Or my brains will explode

[Chorus]
Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

See the hills from afar
Standing on my beat up car
The sun went down
And the night fills the sky
Now I feel like me once again
As the train comes a-rollin' in
Smoked my boredom gone
Slapped my brains up so high

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense

And hail comes crashing down, welting my face
Magic man, egocentric plastic man
Yet you still got one over on me

If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise

It reassures me just to know that you're okay

You asked me what's my pleasure?

And tell you of my dreaming

And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky
Flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry the tears
Left on my face, I've cried

Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

I'll send a letter to that girl
Asking her to be my own
But my pen is writing wrong
So I'll say it in a song
Oh, I love you more right now
More than I've ever loved before
Here's these words straight from these lips
I'll need you forever more

Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

Let's get plowed and plow down some old ladies
Mix a drink and bump the stereo

Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you

Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment checks
Like a flunkie only along for the ride

Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
What's in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse!

And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still when it's do or die

It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin'

I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face, say!

[Verse 3]
I'm on a mission, I got no decision
Like a cripple running the rat race
A wish in one hand, shit in the other
And see which one gets filled first
[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well I don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face, say!

Bittersweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbing toothache of the mind
I can't take this feeling anymore

Drain the pressure from the swelling

Give me a long kiss goodnight

["She's A Rebel"]

[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she’s a saint
She’s the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She’s a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

[Verse 1]
From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's the symbol of resistance
And she’s holding on my heart like a hand grenade
[Verse 2]
Is she dreaming what I'm thinking?
Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody

[Bridge]
She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind

[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Nothing's gonna change my mind
I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've meant

A loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And all the shit you put me through
[Chorus]
Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've meant

[Refrain]
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'

[Bridge]
Do you ever think back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to nothin'?

[Refrain]
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopyLove conquers every time
When two hearts come to collide
You're the card in my Valentine
And the candy hearts in my mind

When true love is the rule
And you're nobody's fool
The shapes come into the light
And  it was love at first sight

Baby, Baby, you're the light
And the flame that burns in my mind's eye
When triumph leads into bliss
And I knew it from the first kiss

Hey, mister, where you headed?
Are you in a hurry?
Need a lift to happy hour? Say "oh no"
Do you brake for distilled spirits?

Cold turkey's getting stale

When the sun beats down on the halfway house
Has my conscience beating
The sound in my ear, the will to persevere
As I reach the break of day

When you lost all hope and excuses
And the cheapskates and the losers
Nothing's left to cling onto
Got to hold on, hold on to yourself

A cry of hope, a plea for peace
And my conscience beating
It's not what I want, for it's all that I need

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only
If you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live

[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
What the hell's your name? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
What's your pleasure and what is your pain? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Do you dream too much? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Do you think what you need is a crutch?
[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
In the crowd of pain
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says, "We're fucked up, but we're not the same
And Mom and Dad are the ones you can blame"

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Jimmy died today (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
He blew his brains out into the bay (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
In the state of mind (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
It's my own private suicide
[Part 2: East 12th St.]

[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

[Verse 3: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world, and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
She had enough, and he had plenty
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
(Ah-ah) So far away, I don't wanna stay (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) Get me out of here right now (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) I just wanna be free, is there a possibility? (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) Get me out of here right now
(Out, out, out, out) Right!
This life-like dream ain't for me!

[Part 3: Nobody Likes You]

[Verse 4: Mike Dirnt]
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After ten cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song, but something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone, 'cause no one's here

[Pre-Chorus]
Left me here alone
And I shoulda stayed home
After ten cups of coffee I'm thinking...
[Chorus: Mike Dirnt]
(Where'd you go?) Nobody likes you, everyone left you
(Where'd you go?) They're all out without you, havin' fun
(Where'd you go?) Everyone left you, nobody likes you
(Where'd you go?) They're all out without you, havin' fun

[Intro: Tré Cool]
Jeez! *sigh*

[Verse 5: Tré Cool & Billie Joe Armstrong]
I got a rock and roll band, I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend and another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house, I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums, and I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York, I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin' in over twenty-two days
(Don't want to be an American idiot!)
So get off my case, off of my case, off of my case!
[Part 5: We're Coming Home Again]

[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Hey!

[Verse 6: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Here they come, marching down the street (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Like a desperation murmur of a heartbeat (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
Their time has come, and it's goin' nowhere (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Nobody ever said that life was fair, now (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bare
In the summer heat

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
The world is spinning 'round and 'round out of control again
The 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb, and visit me in Hell
We're the ones going...

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
(Ooh) I started fuckin' running as soon as my
(Ooh) Feet touched ground
(Ooh) We're back in the barrio
(Ooh) And to you and me, that's Jingle Town

That's home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

Maybe you're the runner-up, but the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in horseshoes and handgrenades

So don't you fuck me around

Sitting on my crucifix
The living room, or my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
To keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Part II: City of the Damned]

[Verse 3: Billie Joe Armstrong]
At the center of the Earth, in the parking lot
Of the 7-Eleven where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says "home is where your heart is," but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care
[Verse 4: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care (Hey!)

[Part III: I Don't Care]

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care

I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care

[Verse 5: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled, but never saved
From the cradles to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia!

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe
(Said it's, it's another lie!)
And I don't believe

[Outro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)

[Part IV: Dearly Beloved]

[Verse 6: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented, or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 7: Billie Joe Armstrong]
(Ooh, ooh) Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
(Ooh, ooh) Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Part V: Tales of Another Broken Home]

[Bass Solo]

[Verse 8: Billie Joe Armstrong]
To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

[Verse 9: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the lights of masochists

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I've walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized

[Verse 1]
I fucked up again, it's all my fault
So turn me around and face the wall
And read me my rights and tell me I am wrong
Until it gets into my thick skull
A slap on the wrist, a stab in the back
Torture me, I've been a bad boy
Nail me to the cross and tell me you have won
I lost before I did any wrong

[Verse 2]
I'm hexed with regrets and bad luck
So keep your distance, it's rubbing off
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell
Or Earth with me tangled at your feet
You finally met your nemesis
Disguised as your fatal long lost love
So kiss it goodbye until death do we part
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
He never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go
Johny be good

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade
Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go
Johny be good

His mama told him someday he would be a man
And he would be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear him play his music when the sun go down
Maybe someday his name would be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy[Verse 1]

Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel
Ah, how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy[Bass Solo]

[Verse 1]
I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors, and I'm fuckin' lazy

[Chorus]
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

[Verse 2]
Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell and I lost the key

[Chorus]
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit
[Bridge]
I got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration, huh!

[Verse 3]
I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will (We will!)
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely

[Chorus]
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
I'm tripping away to paradise
Some say quit or I'll go blind
But it's just a myth36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy[Intro]
Wow!

[Verse 1]
I'm takin' down all my enemies 'cause they're all so fucking useless
A bunch of shit-talkin' drama queens, and they're all filled with excuses
I wanna find me a better scene where it's not the same opinion
I'd rather go to a funeral than into this high school reunion

[Pre-Chorus]
April fool, thought you were falling in love
But now you're suckin' on the doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
And you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time

[Chorus]
'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy, now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control

[Verse 2]
Hangin' out all by myself, at least I'm in good company
Hey, isn't that ol' what's-his-face that I see walking down the street?
I'm gonna hide in the shadows 'cause I really got nothing to say
We never had anything in common, and I never liked you anyway
[Pre-Chorus]
April fool, thought you were falling in love
But when you're suckin' on the doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing son of a bitch
And you're a stupid motherfucker serving shit to the pigs

Today's the Macy's Day Parade
The night of the living dead is on its way
With a credit report for duty call
It's a lifetime guarantee
Stuffed in a coffin, 10% more free
Red light special at the mausoleum

Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed to you
What's the consolation prize?
Economy sized dreams of hope

When I was a kid, I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
Oh-oh, but I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between thieves and crooks
Lesson learned to me and you

Billie Joe, it certainly is exciting to meet you here at the recording studio, right after you've just made your very first record! How does it feel?
Hmmm... Wonderful!

[Verse 1]
She smashed the radio with the board of education
Turned up the static left of the state of the nation

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn on the flame, step on the gas
Burning the flag at half mast
She's the rebel forgotten son
An export of the revolution

[Verse 2]
She is the first voice of the last one's in the line
She'll drag the weights to keep the vendetta alive

Bring in the head of the government
The dog ate the document
Someone shot the president
And no one knows where Maria went!

Be careful what you're offering
Your breath lacks the conviction
Drawing a line in the dirt

I think about you girls I may have torn my dreams apart

I want to show you new things and I'll try keeping time

Thoughts moving closer for me it's hard for me, too hard

I guess it's always been like that (¿¿¿ I practice all the dreams i've had)

Maybe forever, sucked in

If I could know decisions coming from my heart

I think about you girls I may have torn my dreams apart

Keep me on the right track to the trail on top of the edge

No longer feeling I know that they just don't care

I guess it's always been like that

Maybe forever, sucked in

I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

[Verse 1]
I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog, there of which I stand alone
A face in the crowd unsung against the mold
Without a doubt, singled out, the only way I know

I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority

Like a sheep runs from the herd
Marching out of time
To my own beat, now

Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud," she screamed unto me

Virginia was a lot-lizard from FLA
She had a compound fracture in the "trunk"
It started when she ran away
Thumbs out on the interstate
She hitched a ride to misery
Mr. Whirly had a catastrophic incident
He fell into the city by the bay
He liquidated his estate
Now he sleeps upon the Haight
Panhandling misery

[Chorus]
And he's gonna get high, high, high
When he's low, low, low
The fire burns from better days
And she screams, "Why, oh, why?"
I said, "I don't know"
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery

[Verse 2]
The Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam
He ran the drug cartel in Tinseltown
They found him in a Cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat
In the name of misery
Then Gina hit the road to New York City
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked
She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virginia and the dope
And kissed the bride eternally
[Chorus]
And they're gonna get high, high, high
When they're low, low, low
The fire burns from better days
And she screamed, "Why, oh, why?"
I said, "I don't know"
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery

[Bridge]
Well, hell hounds on your trail now once again, boy
It's groping on your leg until it sleeps
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow
'Cause it's not what you make, it's what you leave

Ah!

[Chorus]
And we're gonna get high, high, high
When we're low, low, low
The fire burns for better days

In my clothes, inside a room that's vacant
Lost my nerve, and it's un-nerving
I know there is something I'm forgetting

Oh, I searched the moon, I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the street
I'm pounding the pavement, looking

You're not around
And I'm a complete disaster

Don't forget, 'cause it's not over (Over)

What's that I hear? You want to go for a ride?
Oh, don't be afraid, boy, to come inside
I got that thing that you want, the fix that you need
And hase this with a little lust and greed

For my black heart beats crimson and clover
So operator, operator, patch my boy in

Girls hang on bar stools for late last calls
This town is full of snakes, mistakes, and whiskey shakes
It's too late, I already cut the brakes

Juliet's trying
To find out what she wants, but she don't know
Experience has got her down
Well, look this direction
I know it's not perfection, it's just me
I want to bring you up again, now

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliet's crying
Well, now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy
And a bit lazy, but I will try
To bring you up again, somehow

When I was younger, I thought that the world circled around me
But in time, I realized I was so wrong
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
It was a tragic case of my reality, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you think you're indestructible and no one can touch you?
Well I think you're disposable and it's time you knew the truth

[Chorus]
'Cause it's just one of my lies
Well, it's just one of my lies
And all I wanna do is get real high
Well, it's just one of my lies

[Verse 2]
Why does my life have to be so small, and death is forever?
And does forever have a life to call its own?
Don't give me an answer 'cause you only know as much as I know
Unless you've been there once, well I hardly think so

Do you think you're indestructible and no one can touch you?

But the words would come out wrong
Oh, if you only knew
The way I felt for so long
I know that we're worlds apart
But I just don't seem to care
These feelings in my heart
Only with you I wanna share

The first time I caught
A glimpse of you
Then all my thoughts
Were only of you

I hope that when time goes by
You will think the same about me
Many nights awake I lie
I only wish that you could see
I know that we're only friends
I hope this feeling never ends
If I could only hold you
It's the only thing I wanna do

Well, today, I say sweet things, but tomorrow
I'll be making up excuses for my actions
'Cause it's been so long since I have been in love

Life after youth, faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love, first forgiveness, we were delinquents
Freaks of a fading memory

Outlaws, when we were forever young

We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws

Scars, broken hearts, breaking in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls, bottle rockets, all that we wanted

Got his guitar picking thumb

The sun comes out
Last night was shaking
And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin
So what is wrong
With another sin
The bitch is hungry
She needs to tell
So give her inches
And feed her well
More days to come
New places to go
I’ve got to leave
It’s time for a show

Here I am, rocked you like a hurricane
Here I am, rocked you like a hurricane

My body is burning
It starts to shout
Desire is coming
It breaks out loud
Lust is in cages
Till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it
With someone I choose
The night is calling
I have to go
The wolf is hungry
He runs the show
He’s licking his lips
He’s ready to win
On the hunt tonight
For love at first sting
Here I am, rocked you like a hurricane
Here I am, rocked you like a hurricane
Here I am, rocked you like a hurricane
Here I am, rocked you like a hurricane
Rocked you like a hurricane

It’s early morning
The sun comes out
Last night was shaking
And really loud
My cat is purring
It scracthed my skin

Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel
Ah, how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy[Verse 1]

Whisper, "Are you dying?" in my ear

Thorns shred my fingertips  it drips toxic blood

Someday, we will fight again, well
Your enemies, your tragedies
Pocket knives and rusty chains

I'm like a child looking off in the horizon
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens

St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Lights on the silhouette, he's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of one, two
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
My name is Jimmy, and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves, and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong with Mike Dirnt]
I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city in the halo of lights
Product of war and fear that we've been victimized

I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal

Are you talking to me?
I'll give you something to cry about
Shh! Shh! Shh! St. Jimmy!

[Breakdown: Billie Joe Armstrong]
My name is St. Jimmy, I'm a son of a gun
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
I'm the one that's from the way outside, now
A teenage assassin executing some fun
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
In the cult of the life of crime, now
I really hate to say it, but I told you so
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down, ol' boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
I'm the resident leader of the lost and found

It's St. Jimmy, and that's my name

Looking at the clouds in the sky
Floating image in my mind
Land of beauty and land of peace
Now I wonder where this place is from
The evidence is everywhere
I start to run, and now I'm scared
Strange beings all around
Come everyone to this place I've found

I'm feeling psyched to be walking
I wonder why
All my joys could be open
No more cries

My eyes are clear and now I'm cured
Don't you wanna be for sure?
I know my rights, I'm allowed to die
So I'd rather swap your different guise
It's in my head if you will find
Mother love from all mankind
You look above and then you shout
No other way to say your head is fine

Ripping up my transfer and a photograph of you
You're a blur of my dead past and rotting existence
As I stand laughing on the corner of insignificance

Well, destiny is dead
In the hands of bad luck
Before, it might have made some sense
But now it's all fucked up

Seasons change as well as minds, and I'm a two-faced clown

Can you hear the sound of the static noise
Blasting out in stereo?
Cater to the class and the paranoid
Music to my nervous system
Advertising love and religion
Murder on the airwaves
Slogans on the brink of corruption

[Pre-Chorus]
Visions of blasphemy, war and peace
Oh-oh, screaming at you

[Chorus]
I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

[Verse 2]
Billboard on the rise in the dawn's landscape
Working your insanity
Tragic à la madness and concrete
Coca Cola execution
Conscience on a cross and your heart's in a vise
Squeezing out your state of mind
Are what you own that you cannot buy
[Pre-Chorus]
What a fucking tragedy, strategy
Oh-oh, screaming at you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All I want to know is a god-damned thing
Not what's in the medicine
All I want to do is I want to breathe
Batteries are not included
What's the latest way that a man can die?
Screaming "Hallelujah" (Hallelujah)
Singing out "the dawn's early light"
[Pre-Chorus]
The silence of the rotten, forgotten
Oh-oh, screaming at you

I can't see a thing in the video

Cheapskate on the hill, a thrill seeker making deals
Sugar city urchin wasting time
Town of lunatics begging for another fix
Turning tricks for speedballs one more night

[Chorus]
Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride, burning daylight
Last up at dawn, Tight Wad Hill

Drugstore hooligan, another white trash mannequin
On display to rot up on the hill
Living out a lie, but having the time of his life
Hating every minute of his existence

Bumming a ride, burning daylight

I was a high school atom bomb
Goin' off on the weekends
Smokin' dope and mowing lawns
And I hated all the new trends

My daddy always was on strike
Going off with the teamsters
He said that "Everything'll be alright
Not every Sunday can be Easter"

Hey, Gloria, are you standing close to the edge?
Look out to the setting sun, the brink of your vision
Eternal youth is a landscape of a lie
The cracks of my skin can prove, as the years will testify
Say your prayers and light a fire, we're gonna start a war
Your slogan's a gun for hire, it's what we waited for...
Hey, Gloria, this is why we're on the edge
The fight of our life's been drawn to this undying love

[Chorus]
Gloria! ¡Viva la Gloria!
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls
Falling in broken glass that's slashing through your spirit
I can hear it like a jilted crowd!
Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins
Ashes to ashes of our youth!

She smashed her knuckles into winter (Gloria!)
As autumn's wind fades into black
She is the saint of all the sinners (Gloria!)
The one that's fallen through the cracks
So don't put away your burning light!

Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
Don't lose your faith to your lost naiveté
Weather the storm, and don't look back on last November
When your banners were burning down!

Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted
Bring us the season that we always will remember
Don't let the bonfires go out!

The light that shadows in the night

Thinking out loud and acting in vain

As the key to unlock all the love that's trapped in me
So tell me when it's time to say I love you

[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
All I want is you to understand
That when I take your hand, it's 'cause I want to
We are all born in a world of doubt
But there's no doubt
I figured out
I love you

[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
All I want is you to understand
That when I take your hand, it's 'cause I want to
We are all born in a world of doubt
But there's no doubt
I figured out
I love you
[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And I feel lonely for
All the losers that will never take the time to say
What was really on their mind, instead
They just hide away

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Yet they'll never have
Someone like you to guard them and help along the way
Or tell them when it's time to say I love you
So tell me when it's time to say I love you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy[Verse 1]
A thought burst in my head
And I need to tell you
It's news that I forethought
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
I think I just forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting

[Verse 2]
I shuffle through my mind
To see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
Oh well, never mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Well it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting

[Bridge]

I saw you standing alone
With a sad look on your face
You call him on the phone
Looks like he left without a trace
Tears falling outta your eyes
He's living in a disguise
You've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it's right or wrong

[Chorus]
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?

[Verse 2]
Now many days have gone by
You still just sit there and cry
You're feeling bad for yourself
His memory will always dwell
You're so obsessed with his love
That's why push came to shove
You've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it's right or wrong

[Chorus]
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
[Bridge]
I thought a way out
Throw it all away
Just think about
Yeah, something to say

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy[Verse 1]
She, she's my wild one (Wild one)
My heart is in panic, her eyes look so manic, now
She, little wild one (Wild one)
My heart is a chaser, she's strung out on razors, now

[Chorus]
She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinkin' the Kool-Aid, I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow, hello

[Verse 2]
She, she's my wild one (Wild one)
My heart is in danger, from shadows and strangers, now
She, little wild one (Wild one)
She's covered in angels and demons and halos, now

[Chorus]
She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I'm drinkin' the Kool-Aid, I jumped on the grenade
Now that my mind's gonna blow, hello

[Bridge]

She gave up on Jesus for living on Venus
All fucked up with nowhere to go

Now it seems I can't keep my mind above you
My brain drifts back to better days we've been through
Like sitting on blacktops of the school grounds
The love I bitched about, I finally had found

[Chorus]
But now it's gone and I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

[Verse 2]
Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me, I am blind without a cause
And now I realized what I have lost

[Chorus]
It was something real that I could've had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad
Why?

[Bridge]
Tell me what the words I might have said
That's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late?
Just tell me the words I might have ate
The words I might have ate
The words I might have ate
[Chorus]
But now it's gone and I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

As soon as you're born, they make you feel small
By giving you no time, instead of it all
Until the pain is so big, you feel nothing at all

[Chorus]
A working-class hero is something to be
A working-class hero is something to be

[Verse 2]
They hurt you at home, and they hit you at school
They hate if you're clever, and despise a fool
Until you're so fucking crazy, you can't follow their rules

[Chorus]
A working-class hero is something to be
A working-class hero is something to be

[Verse 3]
When they've tortured and scared you for 20-odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear

[Chorus]
A working-class hero is something to be
A working-class hero is something to be
[Verse 4]
They keep you doped up with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

[Chorus]
A working-class hero is something to be
A working-class hero is something to be

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
There's room at the top, they're telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like all the folks on the hill

[Chorus]
A working-class hero is something to be
A working-class hero is something to be
A working-class hero is something to be
A working-class hero is something to be
A working-class hero is something to be
A working-class hero is something to be

I'm feeling bad about things as you can see
You've got this fire that i'm trying to find
Don't you know that you're my only desire
I love to listen and hear your gentle voice
You take me their your Skin so soft and moist
You talk to me and it makes me feel better
I know the reason I've been so wrong about you
I love to listen to your words, girl, and what you say
Take my reasons cos you know i believe you should stay?
Look in my eyes and tell me what you find
With passion burning I know it's hard to find
I'll write a letter and send it to you with love
I'd like to know, what are your thoughts about us?
A gentle kiss and then I wonder why
You've dried the tears for so many years ive cried
That emotion, when I think of us
Would you of guessed what we have nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy[Intro]
Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again, dragged it through the mud
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone
The worry rock has turned to dust, fallen on our pride

[Pre-Chorus]
A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here and what did you do with the directions?
Promise me no dead end streets
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road

Smell your Technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like it's so enlightening
Staring in the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

[Chorus]
Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud, and it goes...

[Verse 2]
Wearing a psychotic red alert
Your bouquet of flowers in the dirt
Radioactive and primal, nuclear and so delightful
Wearing Day-Glo where you know it hurts

Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud, and it goes...

Hey, little kid, did you wake up late one day?
And you're not so young, but you're still dumb
And you're numb to your own glory, even now it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I fell in love, but it didn't catch your fall
And then I crashed into a wall
And then I fell to pieces on the floor
Now you're sick to death

[Chorus]
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over and out
Over and out again

[Verse 2]
I once was old enough to know better
Then I was too young to care, but who cares?
I probably would, but Hollywood is dead and gone

[Pre-Chorus]
You fell in love, but then you just fell apart
Like a kick in the head, you're an X-Kid
And you never even got started again
[Chorus]
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over and out
Over and out...

[Bridge]
And you were searching your soul
And you got lost and out of control
You went over the edge of joking
Died of a broken heart

[Verse 3]
Hey, little kid, did you wake up late one day?
And you're not so young, but you're still dumb
You're an X-kid and you never even got started again

Hey, X-Kid, bombs away

Season's greeting cards and Christmas
Lights light up the city at the end of the year
This time I got no resolutions
Giving thanks for nothing, but joy into the year

[Chorus]
Tonight, friends are what it's worth, peace and love on Earth
And another year giving thanks again
The sleigh bells deck the halls with goodwill
Say a prayer for lost souls, Christmas time of the year

[Chorus]
Tonight, friends are what it's worth, peace and love on Earth
And another year giving thanks again
Somewhere around a plastic manger, giving thanks to strangers

You got a problem you just can't hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath is taking up all the air
Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head

[Chorus]
Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse, you lied

[Verse 2]
Your mother allowed you just one white lie
But now she's dead and she left you with a problem
Pinocchio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growing into the third dimension

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse, you lied (Uh, you lied)

Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
Punch drunken youngblood

[Verse 1]
She's a loner, not a stoner
Bleeding heart and the soul of Ms. Teresa
Supernova, Cherry Cola
She's the cedar in the trees of Minnesota
Ah-ah ah-ah, ah-ah ah-ah, ah-ah ah-ah

[Verse2]
I'm a rough boy 'round the edges
Gettin' drunk and falling into hedges
She's my weakness, fuckin' genius
Swear to God, and I'm not even superstitious

Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
Punch drunken youngblood

I wanna hold you like a gun
We'll shoot the moon into the sun

Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood

Are you stranded like I'm stranded?
Do you wanna watch the world fall to pieces?
Are you broken like I'm broken?
Are you restless? She said, "Fuck you, I'm from Oakland!"

She's my little youngblood
